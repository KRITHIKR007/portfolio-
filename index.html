        <p>I am a passionate computer science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Jain Deemed-to-be University, with an expected graduation in May 2025. My journey in technology has been enriched by my roles at The Turing Club, where I serve as the Senior Designer and Outreach Lead. In this position, I spearhead outreach initiatives, design promotional materials, and organize tech workshops, empowering fellow students with industry-standard skills and experiences.

            My internship experiences at Walmart and Goldman Sachs have further equipped me with practical insights into operations and finance. At Walmart, I optimized processes and enhanced customer service strategies, while at Goldman Sachs, I contributed to financial analysis projects and developed investment models.
            
            Additionally, I recently completed a job simulation with JPMorgan Chase, where I identified M&A targets and constructed financial models, honing my analytical and communication skills.
            
            I am excited about integrating AIML with design to create innovative products and am always eager to learn and collaborate on impactful projects.</p>
